#A Database System to Search and Correlate Compromised Records Fast

Gilbert Liu

##Abstract

User data leaking incidents are quite common these days. It is currently difficult to extract useful information automatically due to heterogeneity of original data sources. A general database system that indexes and searches compromised records efficiently is described in this paper. Also a method to correlate records to show whether a subset of such records are related to a real world entity is introduced. This research may benefit both security researchers and internet users in the perspective of privacy protection.

Keywords: **Database, Indexing, Heterogeneity, Correlation**
